# MagQHE

Set of tools to performs magnetization calculations (analytical and numerical) for a 2D electron gas in quantum Hall regime.

You can see what can be done with the different function with this app: https://magnetqhe.herokuapp.com/


The analytical calculations are based on those published here: A Potts et al 1996 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 8 5189
The numerical calculations allow to account for spin splitting.
